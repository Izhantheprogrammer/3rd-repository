#Python User Input
'''
Python allows for user input.

That means we are able to ask the user for input.

The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.

Python 3.6 uses the input() method.

'''
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is:" + username)

#Example
name = input("Enter Your name:")
age = int(input("Enter your age"))
print("Your name is :",name,"Your age is",age)
